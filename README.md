**_Abstract_**

Research shows that anxiety in mathematics (MA) negatively correlates with mathematics performance (MP), but few studies examine how often students deviate from this pattern. To examine different relationships between these two constructs, in two consecutive studies (N=1,029 and N=473), we applied k-means clustering to middle-school students based on their MP and MA levels and the results revealed four groups of similar sizes. While two groups’ profiles were in line with most previous studies—high MP low MA and low MP high MA—the other two clusters demonstrated a different pattern. Specifically, about one-fourth of the students showed low MP and low MA, and the rest of the participants demonstrated high MP and high MA. Moreover, clusters differed in their self-reported math self-efficacy, specifically, students with high MP low MA reported significantly lower math self-efficacy compared to students with low MP low MA.
